## Abstract

In recent years, deep learning systems have shown a concerning trend toward increased complexity and higher energy consumption. As researchers in this domain and organizers of one of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events challenges task, we recognize the importance of addressing the environmental impact
of data-driven SED systems. In this paper, we propose an analysis focused on SED systems based on the challenge submissions. This includes a comparison across the past two years and a detailed analysis of this year’s SED systems. Through this research, we aim to explore how the SED systems are evolving every year in relation to their energy efficiency implications.


## Install & Usage

In order to run the jupyter notebook, you need to clone the repo, create a virtual environment and install the needed packages.

You can create the virtual environment and install the needed packages using conda with the following command: 

```
conda create --name <env> --file requirement.txt
```

Once everything is installed, you can run the Jupyter Notebook following the instruction reported on it, and reproduce the results.
